# Geography_RxWiki
Geography of independent pharmacies using RxWiki's services

Using the `ggmap` package (and a few [Hadley Wickham](http://had.co.nz/) packages), 
I plotted the locations of independent pharmacies who are capitalizing on the services 
provided by [RxWiki](rxwiki.com).

# Code
The code for this project is contained entirely in the file
[Maps of clients.Rmd](https://github.com/HunterRatliff1/Geography_RxWiki/blob/master/Maps%20of%20clients.Rmd).
I've cached the geolocations under 
[/data/Geo.csv](https://github.com/HunterRatliff1/Geography_RxWiki/blob/master/data/Geo.csv), 
and the outputs are saved as four `.png` files under the
[/outputs/](https://github.com/HunterRatliff1/Geography_RxWiki/tree/master/outputs) 
subdirectory.
